## Various Event objects in java :

![](https://static.javatpoint.com/images/awthierarchy.jpg)


There are many types of events that are generated by your AWT Application. These events are used to make the application more effective and efficient. Generally, there are twelve types of event are used in Java AWT. These are as follows : 

1. ActionEvent
2. AdjustmentEvent
3. ComponentEvent
4. ContainerEvent
5. FocusEvent
6. InputEvent
7. ItemEvent
8. KeyEvent
9. MouseEvent
10. PaintEvent
11. TextEvent
12. WindowEvent

### Eventobject
An event listener is an object that "listens" for events from a GUI component, like a button. An event, like a button click, is represented as an object. When the user generates an event, the system creates an event object which is then sent to the listener that has been registered for the GUI component. Then, a method in the listener object is invoked.
Action Event Class
An Action Event is generated when:
a button is pressed.
a list item is double clicked.
menu item is clicked.
## Constructor
ActionEvent(Object src, int type, String cmd)
ActionEvent(Object src, int type, String cmd, int modifiers)
ActionEvent(Object src, int type, String cmd, long when, int modifiers)
Here,
src = reference to the object that generated this event.
type = Determine type of event
cmd = command string
modifier = indicates modifier keys (ALT, CTRL, SHIFT); values are ALT_MASK, CTRL_MASK, SHIFT_MASK
when = specifies when the event occured

You can obtain the command name for the envoking ActionEvent object by using: String getActionCommand()
For eg:

When a button is pressed, an action event is generated that has a command name equal to the label on that button.

Other Methods :

int getModifier()
long getWhen()

# KeyEvent Class
It is generated when:
Keyboard input occurs
Types of KeyEvent
KEY_PRESSED - generated when key is pressed.
KEY_RELEASED - generated when key is released.
KEY_TYPED - generated when key is generated.
Constants
VK_ALT, VK_DOWN, VK_LEFT, VK_RIGHT, VK_ENTER, VK_ESCAPE, VK_CONTROL, VK_SHIFT,

# Methods:
int getX()
int getY()
Point getPoint() -> gives object that contain X, Y co-ordinates
int getClickCount()
boolean isPopupTrigger() -> tests if this events causes a pop-up menu to appear on this platform.
int getButton() -> returns a values that represents the button that caused the event.E


example
import java.awt.*;  
import java.awt.event.*;  
class AEvent extends Frame implements ActionListener{  
TextField tf;  
AEvent(){  
  
//create components  
tf=new TextField();  
tf.setBounds(60,50,170,20);  
Button b=new Button("click me");  
b.setBounds(100,120,80,30);  
  
//register listener  
b.addActionListener(this);//passing current instance  
  
//add components and set size, layout and visibility  
add(b);add(tf);  
setSize(300,300);  
setLayout(null);  
setVisible(true);  
}  
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){  
tf.setText("Welcome");  
}  
public static void main(String args[]){  
new AEvent();  
}  
}

#Q.2, Explain Event listeners interfaces with its methods
The event delegation model contains two main components. First are the event sources and second are the listeners. Most of the listener interfaces are available in the java.awt.event package. In Java, there are several event listener interfaces which are listed below:

 

# 1.ActionListener

 

This interface deals with the action events. Following is the event handling method available in the ActionListener interface:

 

void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae)

 

# 2.AdjustmentListener

 

This interface deals with the adjustment event generated by the scroll bar. Following is the event handling method available in the AdjustmentListener interface:

 

void adjustmentValueChanged(AdjustmentEvent ae)

 

# 3.ComponentListener

 

This interface deals with the component events. Following are the event handling methods available in the ComponentListener interface:

 

void componentResized(ComponentEvent ce)

void componentMoved(ComponentEvent ce)

void componentShown(ComponentEvent ce)

void componentHidden(ComponentEvent ce)

 

# 4.ContainerListener

 

This interface deals with the events that can be generated on containers. Following are the event handling methods available in the ContainerListener interface:

 

void componentAdded(ContainerEvent ce)

void componentRemoved(ContainerEvent ce)

 

# 5.FocusListener

 

This interface deals with focus events that can be generated on different components or containers. Following are the event handling methods available in the FocusListener interface:

 

void focusGained(FocusEvent fe)

void focusLost(FocusEvent fe)

 

# 6.ItemListener

 

This interface deals with the item event. Following is the event handling method available in the ItemListener interface:

 

void itemStateChanged(ItemEvent ie)

 

KeyListener

 

This interface deals with the key events. Following are the event handling methods available in the KeyListener interface:

 

void keyPressed(KeyEvent ke)

void keyReleased(KeyEvent ke)

void keyTyped(KeyEvent ke)

 

# 7.MouseListener

 

This interface deals with five of the mouse events. Following are the event handling methods available in the MouseListener interface:

 

void mouseClicked(MouseEvent me)

void mousePressed(MouseEvent me)

void mouseReleased(MouseEvent me)

void mouseEntered(MouseEvent me)

void mouseExited(MouseEvent me)

 

# 8.MouseMotionListener

 

This interface deals with two of the mouse events. Following are the event handling methods available in the MouseMotionListener interface:

 

void mouseMoved(MouseEvent me)

void mouseDragged(MouseEvent me)

 

# 9.MouseWheelListener

 

This interface deals with the mouse wheel event. Following is the event handling method available in the MouseWheelListener interface:

 

void mouseWheelMoved(MouseWheelEvent mwe)

 

# 10.TextListener

 

This interface deals with the text events. Following is the event handling method available in the TextListener interface:

 

void textValueChanged(TextEvent te)

 

WindowFocusListener

 

This interface deals with the window focus events. Following are the event handling methods available in the WindowFocusListener interface:

 

void windowGainedFocus(WindowEvent we)

void windowLostFocus(WindowEvent we)

 

# 11.WindowListener

 

This interface deals with seven of the window events. Following are the event handling methods available in the WindowListener interface:

 

void windowActivated(WindowEvent we)

void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent we)

void windowIconified(WindowEvent we)

void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent we)

void windowOpened(WindowEvent we)

void windowClosed(WindowEvent we)

void windowClosing(WindowEvent we)

#Q.3, How do you handle event with an adaptor class in java?
Adaptor Class
Java adapter classes provide the default implementation of listener interfaces. If you inherit the adapter class, you will not be forced to provide the implementation of all the methods of listener interfaces. So it saves code.

The adapter classes are found in java.awt.event, java.awt.dnd and javax.swing.event packages.

java.awt.event Adapter Classes

Adapter class	| Listener interface
-------------   | ------------------
WindowAdapter	| WindowListener
KeyAdapter	| KeyListener
MouseAdapter	| MouseListener
MouseMotionAdapter	| MouseMotionListener
FocusAdapter	| FocusListener
ContainerAdapter	| ContainerListener
HierarchyBoundsAdapter	| HierarchyBoundsListener
java.awt.dnd Adapter classes

Adapter class	| Listener interface
-------------   | ------------------
DragSourceAdapter	| DragSourceListener
DragTargetAdapter	| DragTargetListener
javax.swing.event Adapter classes

Adapter class	| Listener interface
-------------   | ------------------
MouseInputAdapter	| MouseInputListener
InternalFrameAdapter	| InternalFrameListener

***
#Q.4, Explain Closable Frame
A Frame doesnot have a close function in itslef. We have to write some codes to make the frame window close. We can close the AWT Window or Frame by calling dispose() or System.exit() inside windowClosing() method. The windowClosing() method is found in WindowListener interface and WindowAdapter class.

The WindowAdapter class implements WindowListener interfaces. It provides the default implementation of all the 7 methods of WindowListener interface. To override the windowClosing() method, you can either use WindowAdapter class or WindowListener interface.

If you implement the WindowListener interface, you will be forced to override all the 7 methods of WindowListener interface. So it is better to use WindowAdapter class.
