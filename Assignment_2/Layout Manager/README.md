# Java LayoutManagers

   The LayoutManagers are used to arrange components in a particular manner. LayoutManager is an interface that is implemented by all the classes of layout managers. There are following classes that represents the layout managers:

1. java.awt.BorderLayout
2. java.awt.FlowLayout
3. java.awt.GridLayout
4. java.awt.CardLayout
5. java.awt.GridBagLayout
6. javax.swing.BoxLayout
7. javax.swing.GroupLayout
8. javax.swing.ScrollPaneLayout
9. javax.swing.SpringLayout etc.

## Java GridLayout
  The GridLayout is used to arrange the components in rectangular grid. One component is displayed in each rectangle.

### Constructors of GridLayout class
1. GridLayout(): creates a grid layout with one column per component in a row.
2. GridLayout(int rows, int columns): creates a grid layout with the given rows and columns but no gaps between the components.
3. GridLayout(int rows, int columns, int hgap, int vgap): creates a grid layout with the given rows and columns alongwith given horizontal     and vertical gaps.

## Java FlowLayout
The FlowLayout is used to arrange the components in a line, one after another (in a flow). It is the default layout of applet or panel.

### Fields of FlowLayout class
1. public static final int LEFT
2. public static final int RIGHT
3. public static final int CENTER
4. public static final int LEADING
5. public static final int TRAILING

### Constructors of FlowLayout class
1. FlowLayout(): creates a flow layout with centered alignment and a default 5 unit horizontal and vertical gap.
2. FlowLayout(int align): creates a flow layout with the given alignment and a default 5 unit horizontal and vertical gap.
3. FlowLayout(int align, int hgap, int vgap): creates a flow layout with the given alignment and the given horizontal and vertical gap.

## Java CardLayout
The CardLayout class manages the components in such a manner that only one component is visible at a time. It treats each component as a card that is why it is known as CardLayout.

### Constructors of CardLayout class
1. CardLayout(): creates a card layout with zero horizontal and vertical gap.
2. CardLayout(int hgap, int vgap): creates a card layout with the given horizontal and vertical gap.

### Commonly used methods of CardLayout class
1. public void next(Container parent): is used to flip to the next card of the given container.
2. public void previous(Container parent): is used to flip to the previous card of the given container.
3. public void first(Container parent): is used to flip to the first card of the given container.
4. public void last(Container parent): is used to flip to the last card of the given container.
5. public void show(Container parent, String name): is used to flip to the specified card with the given name.
